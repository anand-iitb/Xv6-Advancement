Exercise 4
----------

*	strace uses its standard error output mechanism to display the its results.
	So you need to understand how to redirect error output of a program to a file.
	Otherwise your program output will be mingled with strace results.

	lsblk 1> temp.txt

	It will redirect the standard output to temp.txt
	But you need to redirect standard error output to a file.

*	Run strace on program empty.c and redirect the standard error output to a file.
*	Do the same for hello.c
*	Find all the system calls made by these programs.
